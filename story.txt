In a cold dumbpser a man named Nick Hall woke up. 
He had no idea where he was or even who he was. 
All that he did know is that he felt like he had been starved for the past week and that someone was coming to kill him.
At least he was reading the intent that someone was trying to kill him.
Was he reading someones mind or hearing voices in his head?
Nick wasn't to just lay there and find out.
He got out and started to run as fast as he can.
He could hear footsetps close behind him.
He ran even faster but so did the foot steps.
Thats when it happened, he ran past a storefront as in the reflection he saw
nothing. Not even himself. 
He looked down at his skin to find stange runes swirling around on his skin.
When he lookep back, he could see the concrete melting where he stepped.
