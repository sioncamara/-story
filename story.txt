In a cold dumbpser a man named Nick Hall woke up. 
He had no idea where he was or even who he was. 
All that he did know is that he felt like he had been starved for the past week and that someone was coming to kill him.
At least he was reading the intent that someone was trying to kill him.
Was he reading someones mind or hearing voices in his head?
Nick wasn't to just lay there and find out.
